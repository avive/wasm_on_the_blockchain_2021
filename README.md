## GOALS
>Explore the key topics involved in building a modern blockchain smart contracts execution environment based on wasm technology.

- Get together people from wasm community together with people working on modern blockchain smart contracts.
- Better understand the challenges, opportunities and requirements for modern blockchain smart contracts execution
- Explore dev toolchains and workflows for coding, debugging and deploying executable code
- Spark collaboration on common cross-project VM and dev workflows specs
- Share learnings and resources between projects

## CONFIRMED TALKS AND HANDS-ON HACKING SESSIONS
- Wasmer.io: a wasm runtime for blockchains
- Parity: Requirements for a wasm execution engine from blockchain perspective and the lightbeam wasm compiler
- EWASM: project vision, status, plan and challenges
- Mozilla: WASM beyond the browser and WASI

## TARGET AUDIENCE
Technical people working on blockchain smart contracts projects or on WASM runtimes, compilers and dev tools.

## FORMAT
